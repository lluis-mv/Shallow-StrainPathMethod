# StrainPathMethod
Matlab to compute the velocities and strains Strains due to the penetration of a tube using the Strain Path Method (Baligh, 1985).

Sagaseta et al (1991) approach is used: the tube moves from the far field to the center of the domain.

Elliptical integrals are computed according to Hollos (2012) [http://www.exstrom.com/math/elliptic/ellipint.html]: it is by far more eficient than using the Matlab build-in elliptical integrals.
